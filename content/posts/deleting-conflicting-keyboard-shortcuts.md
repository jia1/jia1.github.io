I started using JetBrains' IDE recently again but `Cmd + Shift + A` kept triggering something else instead of [Find Action](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/mastering-keyboard-shortcuts.html#learn-shortcuts).

I got that unwanted shortcut disabled. Here's how:

1. Spotlight search (`Cmd + Space`) "keyboard"
2. Go to `Keyboard Settings...`
3. Go to `Keyboard Shortcuts...`
4. Disable the shortcut that's selected in the screenshot below
