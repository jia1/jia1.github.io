Hello to my new theme! Yesterday was Indeed's "You Day" and I spent the day redesigning this site. I am extremely pleased with the result. I was able to follow my hand-drawn wireframe to produce this theme. While this is a simple theme, I made sure to take these things into consideration:

1. Little clutter
1. Consistent margin between sections (`2rem` between sections and `1rem` between post metadata and content)
1. Just 3 font sizes (Foundation's `h1`, `h3` and `h5`)
1. Just 3 colours (background colour: `#F5F5F5`, font colour: `#333333` and dark turquoise: `#26867C`)
1. Reduction of eye strain with lower contrast of colours
1. Colour-blind friendly

Through this experience, I gained more exposure to Hugo and Foundation. There are still some features which I like from the previous theme but have not implemented in this theme:

1. Relevant or similar posts in single post view (list x posts with at least one same tag and reverse-sort by publish date)

And there are features which I thought of and want to implement:

1. List of tags (word cloud?)
1. Archive posts by month and year
1. Making stuff more configurable (see the `TODO` comments all over the theme's codebase)
