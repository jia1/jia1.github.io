This

```css
.some-class {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  min-height: 20rem;
}
```

and this

```css
.some-class {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 20rem;
}
```

appear the same to me.

[CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/align-items/) says,

> You can think of align-items as the justify-content version for the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main-axis).
