## Being Wrong Less

- **Inverse thinking.** Instead of thinking how you can save money, think about how you can reduce your expenses.
- Unforced error. A personal shortcoming which can be controlled.
- **Anti-fragile.** Treating setbacks as challenges and thriving on them.

#### Keep it simple, stupid!

- **Arguing from first principles.**
- **De-risking.** Challenging assumptions and verifying or debunking them.
- Premature optimisation.
- **Minimum viable product.**
- **Ockham's razor.** "The simplest explanation is usually the right one."
- Conjunction fallacy. The assumption that specificity is more probable than generality.
- Overfitting.

#### In the eye of the beholder

- Frame of reference. POV.
- Framing. The way we present a problem to others.
- Nudging. How framing influences the audience.
- Anchoring. The first thing a chick sees will be its "mother".
- Availability bias. Becoming too engrossed with recent information. Product experience personalisations do this.
- Filter bubble. Search engines tailor your experience based on your history and you end up reading about similar things only and nothing else.
- Echo chamber. Consequence of a filter bubble. More polarisation and deviation from objectiveness.

#### Walk a mile in their shoes

- **Third story.** POV of an observer. Should think like one.
- **Most respectful interpretation.** Seeing the best in others.
- **Hanlon's razor.** "Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity."
- Fundamental attribution error. Thinking "someone was mean for the sake of being mean instead of external factors like a bad day".
- Self-serving bias. Always able to explain one's behaviour while thinking that everyone else's is inexplicable.
- **Veil of ignorance.** Considering things without considering our positions.
- Birth lottery.
- Just world hypothesis. "You reap what you sow."
- Victim-blame.
- Learned helplessness.
