> How hungry are you right now?

I'm like 55% full now. Had a cup of water and a red apple when I woke up. Then, I exercised, showered, drank a cup of water and had a green apple. And a moment ago, I ate my in-laws' peanut pancakes from yesterday, and I drank another cup of water. Should get more water plus a cup of milk. I'm all set for the day!
