> Do you plan, or are you flying by the seat of your pants?

To "fly by the seat of your pants" means to do something difficult without the necessary skill or experience ([Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants)).

I'm doing things which I have the necessary skills for but lack experience and exposure, does that count?
