    <p>Last week, I had the honour to be one of the panellists for NUS CFG Internship Thursdays featuring Indeed. This is the profile I shared with NUS:</p>
<p>Jiayee is a software engineer at Indeed. She graduated from NUS Computer Science in 2019 and joined Indeed as a fresh graduate. Before she joined Indeed, she had the opportunity to intern at various reputable companies such as SGInnovate, Visa and ViSenze. At Indeed, she gets the chance to learn from brilliant engineers in the company while indulging her passion for creating impact through technology.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s my answer script for the questions asked during the panel discussion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What were your expectations of an internship?</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Learn skills that will be relevant to my career
<ul>
<li>Use of relevant technology</li>
<li>Soft skills (be a better person!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mentorship
<ul>
<li>Learn from the professionals</li>
<li>Make sure I am on the right track</li>
<li>Not for hand-holding but to help unblock when shit hits the fan (don&rsquo;t say this for real)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learn more about the company
<ul>
<li>Whether I am a good fit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Confirm my choice of career</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>How would I have prepared for an internship differently?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t. I strongly believe that I should focus on improving my technical skills via side projects and soft skills via school projects. This is so I can be better at what I&rsquo;m interested in and stay motivated.
And how would you know if an internship is something you are going to like? Ask about the company and internship.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What helped you receive a return offer back then?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not receiving a return offer doesn&rsquo;t mean that you are bad or incompetent.</p>
<ol>
<li>Attitude
<ul>
<li>It is good to have basic soft skills so that you do not step on toes. Feel free to check with your peers and/or CFG on whether you are on the right track.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ability to learn
<ul>
<li>Companies are not supposed to expect 10 years of experience from you, but they can expect you to pick up the necessary skills quickly to deliver your project.</li>
<li>Furthermore, technology is very fast-paced and we are expected to be able to catch up with these changes quickly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Exceeded expectations
<ul>
<li>Ask questions</li>
<li>Bring new ideas and perspectives to the table</li>
<li>If time permits, propose ways to increase the functionality and/or robustness of your project</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Lastly, do you have any tips or advice for our NUS students here on how they can become a SUPER INTERN during their internships?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Passion. Never do what you don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>Last but not least, there was one question which I prepared for but it wasn&rsquo;t asked. Here you go:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How did you prepare for internships back then?</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Build your resume
<ul>
<li>Find the missing things in your resume (if any) e.g. work experience</li>
<li>Have a plan to obtain these helpful experiences and skills e.g. internships, personal projects</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Boost your problem-solving skills
<ul>
<li>Strong command of data structures and algorithms and applying them to solve various problems</li>
<li>Personal projects</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Apply
<ul>
<li>Study about the company first</li>
<li>Talk to them at career fairs or other outreach events</li>
<li>Do not be afraid of failure</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope these answers will help someone somehow sometime somewhere!</p>
