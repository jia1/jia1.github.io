    <p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I last had the chance to assess several libraries to solve parts of a problem. My most recent project required me to evaluate JavaScript libraries which make form management a breeze. The &ldquo;me&rdquo; in the past would have jumped at any first possibility, like how a chick imprints on the first living thing they see. Not anymore.</p>
<p>My ex-company taught me to set up decision tables and make recommendations according to concrete criteria and their priorities. I thought hard about the non-negotiables and nice-to-haves. For instance, since the company has a design system, the chosen library should be compatible with such an arrangement. And so on.</p>
<p>After much deliberation, I decided against jQuery libraries as I can&rsquo;t measure the cost of <a href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/integrating-with-other-libraries.html">getting jQuery to coexist with React</a>. The company supports the React ecosystem heavily - it would be painful to risk losing that support. The other React libraries had performance and reliability shortcomings. I eventually had my eyes set on this library called <a href="https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form"><code>react-hook-form</code></a>. Proper justification ensued.</p>
<p>To be frank, that was actually the first thing I saw, especially since <a href="https://github.com/opengovsg/FormSG">FormSG</a> was already tapping onto it. Furthermore, it was only pretty recent that they rewrote their codebase from Angular into React. It&rsquo;s like someone else already did the research for me. But, of course, I just can&rsquo;t tell my team that someone outside of the company decided to go with this and hence us too.</p>
<p>Less than a month into this, I&rsquo;m glad to say I made the right choice. The library saved me from having to worry about form state and validation. I could nest my form components without worries. The documentation was clear and concise, too.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate I didn&rsquo;t have enough time to unravel some unexpected behaviour when getting the internal design system to work with this library. I think this is really something to do with the design system. On some form components, <a href="https://react-hook-form.com/api/useform/register/"><code>register</code></a> didn&rsquo;t work. Values didn&rsquo;t get set. Digging deep into the design system is out-of-scope. As such, I proceeded to call <a href="https://react-hook-form.com/api/useform/setvalue/"><code>setValue</code></a> with <code>{ shouldValidate: true }</code> on the relevant events.</p>
<p>If you get stuck in a similar situation, try the above workaround. As the saying goes, &ldquo;Make it work. Make it better. Make it faster.&rdquo;</p>
