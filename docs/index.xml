      <description>Section 3: &amp;ldquo;Reaping the Benefits&amp;rdquo; This section connects better listening and information management to better decision-making and benefits which can span across entire organisations.
Chapter 12: &amp;ldquo;Connecting Better Listening to Better Judgment&amp;rdquo; Learning from others and constantly reconstructing ideas leads to discoveries and insights.
Chapter 13: &amp;ldquo;Changing Your Organisation through Listening&amp;rdquo;  &amp;ldquo;Foster a more disciplined and productive organisation.&amp;rdquo;  The example raised was the organisation of organisation-wide meetings in which speakers are expected to be well-prepared and adhere to strict requirements.</description>

      <description>Section 2: &amp;ldquo;Sorting the Chaos&amp;rdquo; This section breaks down information from general business problems into suggested components. It also lists the questions to ask ourselves so that we remain focused and productive.
Suggested information compartments:
 Mandate Plan Team Execution Personal  Chapter 7: &amp;ldquo;What Is the Mandate?&amp;rdquo;  &amp;ldquo;Why are we here?&amp;rdquo; (Vision, mission, agenda, etc.)  So that we do not lose track and get mesmerised by less important things   &amp;ldquo;Are there any misalignments?</description>

      <title>Power Listening by Bernard T Ferrari</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been borrowing ebooks from NLB ever since I bought my Kobo. I find it difficult to listen in Zoom meetings, so I hope to learn something from this book named &amp;ldquo;Power Listening&amp;rdquo; by Bernard T. Ferrari. I also have difficulty remembering things, so I summarised my takeaways below. I recommend reading the book and penning down notes so that you can appreciate the art of listening based on real-world examples and remember what you need to do to be a good listener.</description>

      <guid>https://jiayee.net/2020/10/pip-uninstall-all/</guid>
      <description>I found a one-liner which can uninstall all pip packages:
pip3 freeze | grep -v &amp;#34;^-e&amp;#34; | xargs sudo pip3 uninstall -y I used to do the following:
pip3 freeze &amp;gt; reqs.txt sudo pip3 uninstall -r reqs.txt I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise I could do pip uninstall -r reqs.txt -y and get rid of those confirmation questions. And I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I messed up the actual requirements file at least once when adopting this approach.</description>

      <description>I did not realise my pull request was between branches of the same repository. Not sure if my friend realised. I moved the feature branch&amp;rsquo;s latest updates to my fork&amp;rsquo;s feature branch. I then made another pull request. I used the following commands to straighten things out:
# Create a local branch with the same name as the origin remote feature branch git checkout -b feat/simple-compound-interest-calculators # Pull in the changes from the origin remote git pull # Set the upstream to the origin remote feature branch git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/feat/simple-compound-interest-calculators feat/simple-compound-interest-calculators # Check the remotes and their URLs git remote -v # Add the remote for my fork git remote add jiayee git@github.</description>

      <description>I thought consolidating constants was evil. Just two or three dozens of them were enough to become a huge headache for me. In Java, this practice is frowned upon. In JavaScript, it seemed alright.
The answer which received the bounty recommended the following:
// Warning: This answer was written in 2014. module.exports = Object.freeze({ MY_CONSTANT: &amp;#39;some value&amp;#39;, ANOTHER_CONSTANT: &amp;#39;another value&amp;#39; }); It was my first time encountering Object.freeze, so I went to google for the difference between Object.</description>

      <description>I needed the client to check for the captcha failure when a user loads a form. In the captchaService abstraction for angular-recaptcha, there was isValid() which does:
/** * Check if the response has been set, assuming captcha is enabled. */ this.isValid = () =&amp;gt; this.response || !this.enabled; I had a way to trigger the captcha failure. In the same WiFi network, I accessed a form from localhost through my mobile phone.</description>

      <description>This
.some-class { display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; min-height: 20rem; } and this
.some-class { display: flex; align-items: center; min-height: 20rem; } appear the same to me.
CSS-Tricks says,
 You can think of align-items as the justify-content version for the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main-axis).

      <description>I was at Page A. Page A calls an API and stores the response in the Redux store. After some clicking, I was routed to Page B. I expected to retrieve the API response stored by Page A. But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t there! The culprit was &amp;lt;a href ...&amp;gt;. I should be using Link or navigate(...) instead.
When I refreshed Page B after getting there via Link, the store went poof again.</description>

      <description>How much time do you spend commuting?
 It&amp;rsquo;s like almost zero nowadays. If not for this pandemic, my trips usually take about 45 minutes each.</description>

      <description>Why &amp;ldquo;Center&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;Centre&amp;rdquo;? Well, that&amp;rsquo;s because &amp;ldquo;center&amp;rdquo; is the version used in CSS.
There were moments in my life when I wanted to give up writing in British English. There are so many other people using American English&amp;hellip; except for me. Programming languages are expressed using American English as well. I felt like a rebel for naming my variables in British English, but that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt in school.</description>

      <description>For the past week, I could not fathom why my diffs seemed to not be on hot reload. It turned out to be a JavaScript heap limit problem. As a result, the codebase did not rebuild and remained stale. This issue does not happen to everyone. I am using a MacBook Air (13-inch, 2017) with 8 GB of RAM.
Notice the line above the last which says, FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory.</description>

      <description>If you need your Redux store to last beyond a page load or refresh, look no further! redux-persist is here to the rescue. Based on this guide and this guide, you need to update your reducers and store to enjoy persistence:
Install redux-persist:
yarn add redux-persist @types/redux-persist Update root reducer and store:
// Copied from the official README and edited import { Provider } from &amp;#39;react-redux&amp;#39;; import { createStore, Store } from &amp;#39;redux&amp;#39;; import { persistReducer, persistStore } from &amp;#39;redux-persist&amp;#39;; import storage from &amp;#39;redux-persist/lib/storage&amp;#39;; import rootReducer from &amp;#39;.</description>

      <description>I decided to invest my time into covering the edge cases that were not handled by Design #1. Refer to yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post for the context. The edge cases are:
 Forms which need data from the preceding forms Dynamic form links  I can deal with the first pain point by leveraging query parameters. A persistent Redux store is not needed (yet). A persistent Redux store is one which persists between page loads and refreshes.</description>

      <title>String.format equivalent in TypeScript</title>

      <description>While working on a problem during work, I thought I needed a way to do a String.format equivalent operation in TypeScript (it turns out I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to). I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to install Lodash (50 kB for _.template alone) or sprintf (40 kB), so I came up with the following:
// Warning: Untested code export const compileTemplate = (template: string, values: Map&amp;lt;string, string&amp;gt;) =&amp;gt; { const variables = Array.from(values.keys()).map(key =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;:&amp;#39; + key).</description>

      <description>I have a few pages which I need to chain into a single form flow. I also need to display a progress bar at the top of each form. I need to do some rearchitecting. Reasons:
 If we do not do anything, we will need to insert &amp;lt;ProgressBar .../&amp;gt; and the like into every form component. Sharing the forms/pages across other flows which do not need to progress bar is difficult.</description>

      <description>There were instances where users filled up a time-consuming form but could not submit it because of reCaptcha failure. Users ended up having to refresh and re-populate the form. That&amp;rsquo;s some harsh user experience. My team uses a forked version of angular-recaptcha. I located the controller, directive and template for the form. I attached a recursive $timeout at the controller and the directive, but as of now, I have not gotten them to work.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: I learnt how to (invert a map) and (copy a map and override the values of the copy) in TypeScript. Ctrl+F TYPESCRIPT_SHORTCUT_1 and TYPESCRIPT_SHORTCUT_2 to get to the code.
Context: Yesterday, I did not invest time into inverting a TypeScript Map&amp;lt;string, string&amp;gt;. Today, I received feedback that I should extract the encode logic into a function of its own. I decided to put in more effort.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the new original code:</description>

      <description>Like this Stack Overflow thread, I needed to encrypt some string which will become part of a URL. However, there was a slash in one of the encrypted strings, like c3ViamVjdHM/X2Q9MQ==. Feel free to decode this. It&amp;rsquo;s something I copied from the internet.
I thought there would be a lot of symbols in the Base64 alphabet at first (I was wrong). I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to deal with them and set up a giant substitution map, like a Map&amp;lt;string, string&amp;gt;.</description>

      <description>How do you get out of a rut?
 A &amp;ldquo;rut&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;a habit or pattern of behaviour that has become dull and unproductive but is hard to change&amp;rdquo;. (Oxford Languages).
Start small. Materialise the plan for your adjustments (e.g. make a planning sheet). Maintain regularity and discipline on these small adjustments until you are comfortable. Always be conscious and bring yourself back whenever you find yourself losing discipline. Make further adjustments.</description>

      <description>I have a GraphQL service and a Spring Boot application. The latter consumes the former. In the application, I transform the retrieved JSON with the help of JSLT. Today, I wrote a JSLT program to do de-duplication and array intersection. Below is the context:
My GraphQL query:
query MyQuery(...) { arrayA: someModel(...) { someInnerModel { id } }, arrayB: someModel(...) { someInnerModel { id } } } Expected JSON response from GraphQL service:</description>

      <description>It was a busy weekend for me. Last Saturday, I went out to catch up with my friends, and I went shopping for an ebook reader. Last Sunday, I cycled with my in-laws and played computer games. On both days, I travelled by public transport, so a couple of hours went into travelling too. Over the weekend, I also had to set up my ebook reader. Besides my HumbleBundle books, I borrowed some books from NLB via OverDrive.</description>

      <description>How hungry are you right now?
 I&amp;rsquo;m like 55% full now. Had a cup of water and a red apple when I woke up. Then, I exercised, showered, drank a cup of water and had a green apple. And a moment ago, I ate my in-laws&#39; peanut pancakes from yesterday, and I drank another cup of water. Should get more water plus a cup of milk. I&amp;rsquo;m all set for the day!</description>

 The principal (P), Annual interest rate (r), Number of months (t), and An optional parameter to represent a periodic top-up amount.  Here&amp;rsquo;s v1 of my simple interest calculator:

      <description>I had a tooltip for a switch which contained 2 lines of text. The first line of the tooltip shows how users can fill the textarea field nearby. The second line reminds users to meet certain prerequisites before filling the field. My GovTech OSS buddy suggested shortening the tooltip depending on user interaction.
At first, the tooltip looked like:
&amp;lt;i class=&amp;#34;...&amp;#34; uib-tooltip=&amp;#34;Here&amp;#39;s the one and only static tooltip!&amp;#34; tooltip-trigger=&amp;#34;&amp;#39;click mouseenter&amp;#39;&amp;#34; &amp;gt;&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; uib-tooltip seems to come from UI Bootstrap.</description>

 To &amp;ldquo;fly by the seat of your pants&amp;rdquo; means to do something difficult without the necessary skill or experience (Cambridge Dictionary).
I&amp;rsquo;m doing things which I have the necessary skills for but lack experience and exposure, does that count?</description>

      <description>I have two form switches. Let&amp;rsquo;s call them A and B. I had to program them such that:
 When A is off, disable and switch B off. When A is on, disable and switch B off.  We can ignore backend logic because I programmed it such that if A is off, ignore B.
So, how did I solve this? I intercepted the data binding with a directive. This may not be the best solution, but it was so convenient and intuitive to me!</description>

Below is a very brief and dry summary of what is more important to me. If I &amp;ldquo;miss&amp;rdquo; something out, it&amp;rsquo;s likely because I remembered it before. This summary does no justice to the workshop, but I want to write them down here before I forget.</description>

      <description>I discovered there were some unexpected styles for &amp;lt;code&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; in this site. This is due to Foundation&amp;rsquo;s default styles. The inline code style was fine, but the same style applied to code blocks (i.e. &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;), and that was not fine. There was also insufficient margin and padding for the code blocks. I inspected the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt; elements. I found out that Foundation was the culprit. It has been styling the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt; elements on top of what Hugo has in store.</description>

      <description>Hello to my new theme! Indeed&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;You Day&amp;rdquo; was yesterday, and I spent the day redesigning this site. I am very pleased with the result. I was able to follow my hand-drawn wireframe to produce this theme. While this is a simple theme, I made sure to consider these things:
 Little clutter Consistent margin between sections. The margin was 2rem between sections and 1rem between post metadata and content. Only 3 font sizes (Foundation&amp;rsquo;s h1, h3 and h5) Only 3 colours (background colour: #F5F5F5, font colour: #333333 and dark turquoise: #26867C) Reduction of eye strain with lower contrast of colours Colour-blind friendly  Through this experience, I gained more exposure to Hugo and Foundation.</description>

      <description>In one of my previous posts, I avoided auto-configuring primitives. Otherwise, the No qualifying bean error will occur. Today, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t avoid that anymore. I had to auto-configure a boolean so that the consumer can enable or disable a feature in application.yml.
So, how did I resolve this issue? I used @Value(&amp;quot;{someKey:someDefault}&amp;quot;) final boolean someFlag in the caller constructor.
Before that, I tried attaching only @Bean to the getter, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t work out.</description>

The latter costs money (the first 3 page rules are free).

      <description>My pre-commit hook complained because the original code had an import that looked like var module = require(&amp;quot;module&amp;quot;). The permitted ways to import are: import foo = require(&#39;foo&#39;) and &amp;ldquo;ES2015-style imports&amp;rdquo; which (I think) is defined in this part of the MDN web docs. I wonder when this rule was inserted&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I needed to test a feature which I have been building for GovTech&amp;rsquo;s FormSG. To test it, I had to mock a function in the superclass of an instance generated by a factory method call. I once considered stripping away the barriers between the mock and the test. But, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to refactor a codebase which I am not too familiar with.
Below is a visualisation of the &amp;ldquo;barriers&amp;rdquo; between the mock and the test:</description>

      <description>I added my domains to Cloudflare. Cloudflare offers many cool features that my domain providers do not offer. Well, they did not need to offer those features. In Cloudflare, I get to see features such as:
 Web traffic analytics Set up DNSSEC Configure network transport options and/or optimisations Run speed tests on my site Configure caching Run JavaScript workers Restrict image hotlinking  This list is non-exhaustive. There are more features in the Pro and Enterprise subscriptions.</description>

      <description>A few days ago, I purchased the jiayee.net domain. Yesterday, I purchased the jiay.ee domain. It was a novel experience for me. I last &amp;ldquo;purchased&amp;rdquo; a domain from Freenom about 3 years ago. Back then, I had the free domain point to my AWS EC2 public IP address (this was for CS3216). This week, my custom domains are pointing towards GitHub pages and Blogger respectively.
For GitHub pages, I followed a guide which is like this one by Rich.</description>

      <description>I wrote my first yarn package (kind of for fun) yesterday. It&amp;rsquo;s strange how I&amp;rsquo;ve been consuming packages but never went to the other side of the table: Writing a package. As of now, I haven&amp;rsquo;t published my package, but I&amp;rsquo;m omw. So, how did I create a package? It just felt like the usual&amp;hellip; I followed the yarn docs.
One difference (compared to my usual activities) was I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do import { .</description>

      <description>I was right. I forgot to enable the Mongo repository. And it wasn&amp;rsquo;t only that. I had two Mongo configuration classes. One in the consumer and another in the custom starter. I needed only one. I removed the configuration class from the custom starter. Then, I enabled the custom starter&amp;rsquo;s repository in the consumer&amp;rsquo;s configuration class. Below is an idea of how my configuration class looks like:

      <title>Auto-configuring controllers and repositories</title>

      <description>I auto-configured Spring Boot REST controllers by adding their names to the spring.factories file. On the other hand, I did not have much luck with auto-configuring Mongo collections (yet).
I then ran the consumer&amp;rsquo;s codebase and used Postman to hit the newly-offered endpoints. Below is the response seen in Postman:
{ &amp;#34;error&amp;#34;: { &amp;#34;IllegalArgumentException&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;Couldn&amp;#39;t find PersistentEntity for type class yourTLD.yourOrg.yourProject.somePackage.SomeModel!&amp;#34; } } I thought the Mongo repository was not auto-configured, so I went to check the consumer&amp;rsquo;s logs.</description>

      <title>Spring Boot Auto-configuration</title>

      <guid>https://jiayee.net/2020/09/spring-boot-auto-configuration/</guid>
      <description>Every time I use Spring Security, I have to copy and paste a lot of boilerplate code. What if I made the boilerplate code configurable? I decided to venture into this idea.
At first, I extracted only the method body which configures HttpSecurity. So I got myself something like a utility library. But this meant there was still some boilerplate code outside of the library. This approach required consumers to define their own configuration classes (annotated with @Configuration).</description>
