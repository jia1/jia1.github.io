      <description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Jiayee. I&amp;rsquo;m currently working as a software engineer at Indeed. I graduated from NUS Computer Science in 2019. Through blogging, I hope to be better at retaining what I learnt. Please keep in mind that not everything in this blog is correct. I am and will always be learning.
