      <description>There were instances where users filled up a time-consuming form but could not submit it because of reCaptcha failure. Users ended up having to refresh and re-populate the form. That&amp;rsquo;s some harsh user experience. My team uses a forked version of angular recaptcha. I located the controller, directive and template for the form. I attached recursive $timeout at the controller and the directive, but as of now, I have not gotten them to work.</description>

      <description>I had a tooltip for a switch which contained 2 lines of text. The first line shows an example on how the textarea field below the switch can be populated, like &amp;ldquo;e.g. example input here&amp;rdquo;. The second line reminds a user that certain prerequisites need to be fulfilled before the textarea field appears and is ready to receive input (hidden otherwise), like &amp;ldquo;You need to do X before you can populate this field&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Intercepting Angular Data Binding</title>

      <description>I have two form switches. Let&amp;rsquo;s call them A and B. I was tasked to program them such that:
 When A is off, B is disabled and off. When A is on, B is enabled but off.  We can safely ignore backend logic because I programmed it such that if A is off, B will be ignored.
So, how did I solve this? I intercepted the data binding with a directive.</description>

      <description>Doing
&amp;lt;textarea placeholder=&amp;#34;line1\nline2&amp;#34;&amp;gt; will not work but doing
&amp;lt;textarea placeholder=&amp;#34;{{ somethingFromScope }}&amp;#34;&amp;gt; where somethingFromScope is line1\nline2 will work as expected!</description>

      <description>Something could&amp;rsquo;ve happened in the past 2 weeks while I was focused on fixing my unit tests. It had been some time since I last did a local deployment. To my surprise, my local deployments in the recent days rendered a blank page with the the following error in the JavaScript console:
Uncaught Error: [$injector:modulerr] Failed to instantiate module FormSG due to: Error: [$injector:modulerr] Failed to instantiate module forms due to: Error: [ng:areq] Argument &amp;#39;directiveFactory&amp;#39; is required I asked my teammate if he has seen this.</description>
