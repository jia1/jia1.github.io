      <description>Being Wrong Less Inverse thinking. Instead of thinking how you can save money, think about how you can reduce your expenses. Unforced error. A personal shortcoming which can be controlled. Anti-fragile. Treating setbacks as challenges and thriving on them. Keep it simple, stupid! Arguing from first principles. De-risking. Challenging assumptions and verifying or debunking them. Premature optimisation. Minimum viable product. Ockham&amp;rsquo;s razor. &amp;ldquo;The simplest explanation is usually the right one.&amp;rdquo; Conjunction fallacy.</description>

      <description>Section 3: &amp;ldquo;Reaping the Benefits&amp;rdquo; This section connects better listening and information management to better decision-making and benefits that can span entire organisations.
Chapter 12: &amp;ldquo;Connecting Better Listening to Better Judgment&amp;rdquo; Learning from others and constantly reconstructing ideas leads to discoveries and insights.
Chapter 13: &amp;ldquo;Changing Your Organisation through Listening&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Foster a more disciplined and productive organisation.&amp;rdquo; The example raised was the organisation of organisation-wide meetings. In these meetings, speakers need to be well-prepared and adhere to strict requirements.</description>

      <description>Section 2: &amp;ldquo;Sorting the Chaos&amp;rdquo; This section breaks down information from general business problems into suggested components. It also lists the questions to ask ourselves so that we remain focused and productive.
Suggested information compartments:
Mandate Plan Team Execution Personal Chapter 7: &amp;ldquo;What Is the Mandate?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Why are we here?&amp;rdquo; (Vision, mission, agenda, etc.) So that we do not lose track and get mesmerised by less important things &amp;ldquo;Are there any misalignments?</description>

      <title>Power Listening by Bernard T Ferrari</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been borrowing ebooks from NLB ever since I bought my Kobo. I find it difficult to listen in Zoom meetings, so I hope to learn something from this book named &amp;ldquo;Power Listening&amp;rdquo; by Bernard T. Ferrari. I also have difficulty remembering things, so I summarised my takeaways below. I recommend reading the book and penning down notes so that you can appreciate the art of listening based on real-world examples and remember what you need to do to be a good listener.</description>
