      <description>Section 2: &amp;ldquo;Sorting the Chaos&amp;rdquo; This section breaks down information from general business problems into suggested components. It also lists the questions to ask ourselves so that we remain focused and productive.
Suggested information compartments:
 Mandate Plan Team Execution Personal  Chapter 7: &amp;ldquo;What Is the Mandate?&amp;rdquo;  &amp;ldquo;Why are we here?&amp;rdquo; (Vision, mission, agenda, etc.)  So that we do not lose track and get mesmerised by less important things   &amp;ldquo;Are there any misalignments?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been borrowing ebooks from NLB ever since I bought my Kobo. I find it difficult to listen in Zoom meetings, so I hope to learn something from this book named &amp;ldquo;Power Listening&amp;rdquo; by Bernard T. Ferrari. I also have difficulty remembering things, so I summarised my takeaways below. I recommend reading the book and penning down notes so that you can appreciate the art of listening based on real-world examples and remember what you need to do to be a good listener.</description>
