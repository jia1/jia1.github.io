      <description>Chapter 5 and 6 were about basic data structures (like arrays, slices and maps) and functions.
package main import &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; func main() { // Chapter 5: Arrays, slices and maps  var x [5]int x[4] = 100 fmt.Println(x) // No coercing when there is a division operation involving a float64 and int  // i.e. (mismatched types float64 and int)  // Should do a / float64(b)  var total float64 = 0 for i, value := range x { total += value } // Different from Python&amp;#39;s range  // Compiler will complain &amp;#34;i declared and not used&amp;#34;, so we must rename unused variables to &amp;#39;_&amp;#39;.</description>

      <description>Chapter 3 and 4 were about variables (var, const and so on) and control structures (for, if and so on).
package main import &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; b := &amp;#34;Hello, world!&amp;#34; // Block scope  func main() { // Chapter 3: Variables  var x string = &amp;#34;Hello, world!&amp;#34; var y string y = &amp;#34;Hello, world!&amp;#34; // x = x + y  // x += y  z := &amp;#34;Hello, world!&amp;#34; var a = &amp;#34;Hello, world!</description>

      <description>It was a busy weekend for me. Last Saturday, I went out to catch up with my friends, and I went shopping for an ebook reader. Last Sunday, I cycled with my in-laws and played computer games. On both days, I travelled by public transport, so a couple of hours went into travelling too. Over the weekend, I also had to set up my ebook reader. Besides my HumbleBundle books, I borrowed some books from NLB via OverDrive.</description>

      <description>Last week, I had the honour to be one of the panellists for NUS CFG Internship Thursdays featuring Indeed. This is the profile I shared with NUS:
Jiayee is a software engineer at Indeed. She graduated from NUS Computer Science in 2019 and joined Indeed as a fresh graduate. Before she joined Indeed, she had the opportunity to intern at various reputable companies such as SGInnovate, Visa and ViSenze. At Indeed, she gets the chance to learn from brilliant engineers in the company while indulging her passion for creating impact through technology.</description>
