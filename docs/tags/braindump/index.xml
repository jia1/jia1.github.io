      <description>Chapter 5 and 6 were about basic data structures (like array, slice and map) and functions respectively.
package main import &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; func main() { // Chapter 5: Arrays, slices and maps  var x [5]int x[4] = 100 fmt.Println(x) // No coercing when there is a division operation involving a float64 and int  // i.e. (mismatched types float64 and int)  // Should do a / float64(b)  var total float64 = 0 for i, value := range x { total += value } // Different from Python&amp;#39;s range  // Compiler will complain &amp;#34;i declared and not used&amp;#34;, so we must rename unused variables to &amp;#39;_&amp;#39;  y := [3]float64{ 1, 2, 3, } // Slice of length 0  var z []float64 // Slice of length 5 but is associated with an array of length 10  a := make([]float64, 5, 10) b := x[0:5] c := x[:5] d := x[0:] e := x[:] slice := append(y, 8, 9) // [1, 2, 3, 8, 9]  dst := [1]float64{0} copy(slice, dst) // dst is now [1]  // min(len(slice), len(dst)) is copied over  var g map[string]int // {[key: string]: int}  g = make(map[string]int) // Or just g := make(map[string]int) without the variable declaration  g[&amp;#34;someKey&amp;#34;] = 0 // delete(g, &amp;#34;someKey&amp;#34;)  lookupResult, lookupSucceeded := g[&amp;#34;someKey&amp;#34;] if result, ok := g[&amp;#34;someKey&amp;#34;]; ok { fmt.</description>

      <description>Chapter 3 and 4 were about variables (var, const and so on) and control structures (for, if and so on) respectively.
package main import &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; b := &amp;#34;Hello, world!&amp;#34; // Block scope  func main() { // Chapter 3: Variables  var x string = &amp;#34;Hello, world!&amp;#34; var y string y = &amp;#34;Hello, world!&amp;#34; // x = x + y  // x += y  z := &amp;#34;Hello, world!&amp;#34; var a = &amp;#34;Hello, world!</description>

      <description>It was a very busy weekend for me. Last Saturday, I went out to catch up with my friends and I went to shop for an e-book reader. Last Sunday, I cycled with my in-laws and played computer games. On both days, I travelled by public transport so a couple of hours went into travelling too. Over the weekend, I also had to set up my e-book reader. In addition to my HumbleBundle books, I borrowed some books from NLB via OverDrive too.</description>

      <description>Last week, I had the honour to be one of the panellists for NUS CFG Internship Thursdays featuring Indeed. Here&amp;rsquo;s the profile I shared:
Jiayee is a software engineer at Indeed. She graduated from NUS Computer Science in 2019 and joined Indeed as a fresh graduate. Before she joined Indeed, she had the opportunity to intern at various reputable companies such as SGInnovate, Visa and ViSenze. At Indeed, she gets the chance to learn from brilliant engineers in the company while indulging her passion for creating impact through technology.</description>
