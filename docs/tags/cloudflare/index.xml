      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time to put my short custom domain to good use. Cloudflare Workers is a quick &amp;lsquo;n&amp;rsquo; dirty way for me to do URL forwarding from various paths of jiay.ee without having to set up DNS records or page rules.

This list is non-exhaustive. There are more features in the Pro and Enterprise subscriptions.</description>
