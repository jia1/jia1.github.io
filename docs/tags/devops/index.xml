      <title>Push vs Pull CDN</title>

      <description>It was only recently that I realised that there was more than one way to update the content that your CDN hosts. Since, to the best of my knowledge, Cloudflare was the closest thing to a CDN, I thought all CDN would work like that. Couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more wrong.
I like that Cloudflare is so hassle-free to set up. It caches my site upon request + nothing in cache. There is no need to push any content to Cloudflare by myself.</description>

      <title>Cloudflare Workers</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time to put my short custom domain to good use. Cloudflare Workers is a quick &amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo; dirty way for me to do URL forwarding. With URL forwarding, I will no longer need to set up DNS records or page rules. The former requires domain verification. Plus, social media websites don&amp;rsquo;t support custom domains (why will they). The latter costs money (the first 3 page rules are free).
My worker&amp;rsquo;s name was &amp;quot;vanity&amp;quot; for obvious reasons and it sits at https://www.</description>

      <title>Adding my sites to Cloudflare</title>

      <description>I added my domains to Cloudflare. Cloudflare offers many cool features that my domain providers don&amp;rsquo;t offer. Well, they didn&amp;rsquo;t need to offer those features. In Cloudflare, I get to see features such as:
Web traffic analytics Set up DNSSEC Configure network transport options and/or optimisations Run speed tests on my site Configure caching Run JavaScript workers Restrict image hotlinking This list is non-exhaustive. There are more features in the Pro and Enterprise subscriptions.</description>

      <title>Custom domains</title>

      <description>A few days ago, I purchased the jiayee.net domain. Yesterday, I purchased the jiay.ee domain. It was a novel experience for me. I last &amp;ldquo;purchased&amp;rdquo; a domain from Freenom about 3 years ago. Back then, I had the free domain point to my AWS EC2 public IP address (this was for CS3216). This week, my custom domains are pointing towards GitHub pages and Blogger respectively.
For GitHub pages, I followed a guide which is like this one by Rich.</description>
