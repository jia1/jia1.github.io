      <title>Style Fixes 1</title>

      <description>Realised some unexpected styles due to Foundation&amp;rsquo;s default styles, mainly for &amp;lt;code&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;. The inline code style was fine but the same style was applied to code blocks (i.e. &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;) and that was not fine. There was also insufficient margin and padding for the code blocks. I went to inspect the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt; elements and found that Foundation was the one who has been styling the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt; elements on top of what Hugo has in store (see official docs for Syntax Highlighting).</description>

      <title>New Theme</title>

      <description>Hello to my new theme! Yesterday was Indeed&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;You Day&amp;rdquo; and I spent the day redesigning this site. I am extremely pleased with the result. I was able to follow my hand-drawn wireframe to produce this theme. While this is a simple theme, I made sure to take these things into consideration:
 Little clutter Consistent margin between sections (2rem between sections and 1rem between post metadata and content) Just 3 font sizes (Foundation&amp;rsquo;s h1, h3 and h5) Just 3 colours (background colour: #F5F5F5, font colour: #333333 and dark turquoise: #26867C) Reduction of eye strain with lower contrast of colours Colour-blind friendly  Through this experience, I gained more exposure to Hugo and Foundation.</description>
