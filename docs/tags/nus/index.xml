      <description>I managed to catch one of the NUS Hackers&#39; workshops, &amp;ldquo;Hacker Tools: Data Wrangling&amp;rdquo; by Julius. I got to learn many new things since I don&amp;rsquo;t use CLI for text processing. Julius&#39; slides are in his GitHub repo.
Below is a very brief and dry summary of what is more important to me. If I &amp;ldquo;miss&amp;rdquo; something out, it&amp;rsquo;s likely because I remembered it before. This summary does no justice to the workshop, but I want to write them down here before I forget.</description>

      <description>Last week, I had the honour to be one of the panellists for NUS CFG Internship Thursdays featuring Indeed. This is the profile I shared with NUS:
Jiayee is a software engineer at Indeed. She graduated from NUS Computer Science in 2019 and joined Indeed as a fresh graduate. Before she joined Indeed, she had the opportunity to intern at various reputable companies such as SGInnovate, Visa and ViSenze. At Indeed, she gets the chance to learn from brilliant engineers in the company while indulging her passion for creating impact through technology.</description>
