      <description>I decided to invest my time into covering the edge cases that were not handled by Design #1 (refer to yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post). The edge cases are:
 Forms which need data from the preceding forms Dynamic form links  The first can be resolved by leveraging query parameters if I do not pursue a persistent Redux store for this. A persistent Redux store is one which persists between page loads and refreshes.</description>

      <description>In one of the flagship products from my team at Indeed, we have 3 pages which were chained into a single form flow. Unlike the first two pages, the last page is shared across other flows. My task is to insert another set of forms (or pages) between the 2nd page and the last page. In a follow-up task, these forms/pages need to display a progress bar at the top. I believe I need to rearchitect this flow.</description>
