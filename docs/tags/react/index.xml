      <description>Need an extra whitespace in JSX? Instead of &amp;amp;nbsp;, try this:
&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Hello, &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; {true ? &amp;#39;world!&amp;#39; : &amp;#39;world!&amp;#39;} Some food for thought here.</description>

      <description>I decided to invest my time into covering the edge cases that were not handled by Design #1. Refer to yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post for the context. The edge cases are:
 Forms which need data from the preceding forms Dynamic form links  I can deal with the first pain point by leveraging query parameters. A persistent Redux store is not needed (yet). A persistent Redux store is one which persists between page loads and refreshes.</description>

      <description>I have a few pages which I need to chain into a single form flow. I also need to display a progress bar at the top of each form. I need to do some rearchitecting. Reasons:
 If we do not do anything, we will need to insert &amp;lt;ProgressBar .../&amp;gt; and the like into every form component. Sharing the forms/pages across other flows which do not need to progress bar is difficult.</description>
