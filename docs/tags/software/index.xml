      <title>Captcha isValid()</title>
      <link>https://jiayee.net/2020/10/captcha-isvalid/</link>

      <guid>https://jiayee.net/2020/10/captcha-isvalid/</guid>
      <description>I needed the client to check for the captcha failure when a user loads a form. In the captchaService abstraction for angular-recaptcha, there was isValid() which does:
/** * Check if the response has been set, assuming captcha is enabled. */ this.isValid = () =&amp;gt; this.response || !this.enabled; I had a way to trigger the captcha failure. In the same WiFi network, I accessed a form from localhost through my mobile phone.</description>

      <description>This
.some-class { display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; min-height: 20rem; } and this
.some-class { display: flex; align-items: center; min-height: 20rem; } appear the same to me.
CSS-Tricks says,
 You can think of align-items as the justify-content version for the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main-axis).

      <title>Redux Poof!</title>

      <description>I was at Page A. Page A calls an API and stores the response in the Redux store. After some clicking, I was routed to Page B. I expected to retrieve the API response stored by Page A. But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t there! The culprit was &amp;lt;a href ...&amp;gt;. I should be using Link or navigate(...) instead.
When I refreshed Page B after getting there via Link, the store went poof again.</description>

      <description>Why &amp;ldquo;Center&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;Centre&amp;rdquo;? Well, that&amp;rsquo;s because &amp;ldquo;center&amp;rdquo; is the version used in CSS.
There were moments in my life when I wanted to give up writing in British English. There are so many other people using American English&amp;hellip; except for me. Programming languages are expressed using American English as well. I felt like a rebel for naming my variables in British English, but that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt in school.</description>

      <description>For the past week, I could not fathom why my diffs seemed to not be on hot reload. It turned out to be a JavaScript heap limit problem. As a result, the codebase did not rebuild and remained stale. This issue does not happen to everyone. I am using a MacBook Air (13-inch, 2017) with 8 GB of RAM.
Notice the line above the last which says, FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory.</description>

      <description>If you need your Redux store to last beyond a page load or refresh, look no further! redux-persist is here to the rescue. Based on this guide and this guide, you need to update your reducers and store to enjoy persistence:
Install redux-persist:
yarn add redux-persist @types/redux-persist Update root reducer and store:
// Copied from the official README and edited import { Provider } from &amp;#39;react-redux&amp;#39;; import { createStore, Store } from &amp;#39;redux&amp;#39;; import { persistReducer, persistStore } from &amp;#39;redux-persist&amp;#39;; import storage from &amp;#39;redux-persist/lib/storage&amp;#39;; import rootReducer from &amp;#39;.</description>

      <description>I decided to invest my time into covering the edge cases that were not handled by Design #1. Refer to yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post for the context. The edge cases are:
 Forms which need data from the preceding forms Dynamic form links  I can deal with the first pain point by leveraging query parameters. A persistent Redux store is not needed (yet). A persistent Redux store is one which persists between page loads and refreshes.</description>

      <title>String.format equivalent in TypeScript</title>

      <description>While working on a problem during work, I thought I needed a way to do a String.format equivalent operation in TypeScript (it turns out I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to). I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to install Lodash (50 kB for _.template alone) or sprintf (40 kB), so I came up with the following:
// Warning: Untested code export const compileTemplate = (template: string, values: Map&amp;lt;string, string&amp;gt;) =&amp;gt; { const variables = Array.from(values.keys()).map(key =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;:&amp;#39; + key).</description>

      <description>I have a few pages which I need to chain into a single form flow. I also need to display a progress bar at the top of each form. I need to do some rearchitecting. Reasons:
 If we do not do anything, we will need to insert &amp;lt;ProgressBar .../&amp;gt; and the like into every form component. Sharing the forms/pages across other flows which do not need to progress bar is difficult.</description>

      <description>There were instances where users filled up a time-consuming form but could not submit it because of reCaptcha failure. Users ended up having to refresh and re-populate the form. That&amp;rsquo;s some harsh user experience. My team uses a forked version of angular-recaptcha. I located the controller, directive and template for the form. I attached a recursive $timeout at the controller and the directive, but as of now, I have not gotten them to work.</description>

      <description>Chapter 5 and 6 were about basic data structures (like arrays, slices and maps) and functions.
package main import &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; func main() { // Chapter 5: Arrays, slices and maps  var x [5]int x[4] = 100 fmt.Println(x) // No coercing when there is a division operation involving a float64 and int  // i.e. (mismatched types float64 and int)  // Should do a / float64(b)  var total float64 = 0 for i, value := range x { total += value } // Different from Python&amp;#39;s range  // Compiler will complain &amp;#34;i declared and not used&amp;#34;, so we must rename unused variables to &amp;#39;_&amp;#39;.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: I learnt how to (invert a map) and (copy a map and override the values of the copy) in TypeScript. Ctrl+F TYPESCRIPT_SHORTCUT_1 and TYPESCRIPT_SHORTCUT_2 to get to the code.
Context: Yesterday, I did not invest time into inverting a TypeScript Map&amp;lt;string, string&amp;gt;. Today, I received feedback that I should extract the encode logic into a function of its own. I decided to put in more effort.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the new original code:</description>

      <description>Like this Stack Overflow thread, I needed to encrypt some string which will become part of a URL. However, there was a slash in one of the encrypted strings, like c3ViamVjdHM/X2Q9MQ==. Feel free to decode this. It&amp;rsquo;s something I copied from the internet.
I thought there would be a lot of symbols in the Base64 alphabet at first (I was wrong). I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to deal with them and set up a giant substitution map, like a Map&amp;lt;string, string&amp;gt;.</description>

      <description>It was a busy weekend for me. Last Saturday, I went out to catch up with my friends, and I went shopping for an ebook reader. Last Sunday, I cycled with my in-laws and played computer games. On both days, I travelled by public transport, so a couple of hours went into travelling too. Over the weekend, I also had to set up my ebook reader. Besides my HumbleBundle books, I borrowed some books from NLB via OverDrive.</description>

The second line reminds users to meet certain prerequisites before filling the field. My GovTech OSS buddy suggested shortening the tooltip depending on user interaction.
At first, the tooltip looked like:
&amp;lt;i class=&amp;#34;...&amp;#34; uib-tooltip=&amp;#34;Here&amp;#39;s the one and only static tooltip!&amp;#34; tooltip-trigger=&amp;#34;&amp;#39;click mouseenter&amp;#39;&amp;#34; &amp;gt;&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; uib-tooltip seems to come from UI Bootstrap.</description>

      <description>I have two form switches. Let&amp;rsquo;s call them A and B. I had to program them such that:
 When A is off, disable and switch B off. When A is on, disable and switch B off.  We can ignore backend logic because I programmed it such that if A is off, ignore B.
So, how did I solve this? I intercepted the data binding with a directive. This may not be the best solution, but it was so convenient and intuitive to me!</description>

Below is a very brief and dry summary of what is more important to me. If I &amp;ldquo;miss&amp;rdquo; something out, it&amp;rsquo;s likely because I remembered it before. This summary does no justice to the workshop, but I want to write them down here before I forget.</description>

      <description>I discovered there were some unexpected styles for &amp;lt;code&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; in this site. This is due to Foundation&amp;rsquo;s default styles. The inline code style was fine, but the same style applied to code blocks (i.e. &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;), and that was not fine. There was also insufficient margin and padding for the code blocks. I inspected the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt; elements. I found out that Foundation was the culprit. It has been styling the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt; elements on top of what Hugo has in store.</description>

I was able to follow my hand-drawn wireframe to produce this theme. While this is a simple theme, I made sure to consider these things:
 Little clutter Consistent margin between sections. The margin was 2rem between sections and 1rem between post metadata and content. Only 3 font sizes (Foundation&amp;rsquo;s h1, h3 and h5) Only 3 colours (background colour: #F5F5F5, font colour: #333333 and dark turquoise: #26867C) Reduction of eye strain with lower contrast of colours Colour-blind friendly  Through this experience, I gained more exposure to Hugo and Foundation.</description>

      <title>No qualifying bean</title>

      <description>In one of my previous posts, I avoided auto-configuring primitives. Otherwise, the No qualifying bean error will occur. Today, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t avoid that anymore. I had to auto-configure a boolean so that the consumer can enable or disable a feature in application.yml.
So, how did I resolve this issue? I used @Value(&amp;quot;{someKey:someDefault}&amp;quot;) final boolean someFlag in the caller constructor.
Before that, I tried attaching only @Bean to the getter, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t work out.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time to put my short custom domain to good use. Cloudflare Workers is a quick &amp;lsquo;n&amp;rsquo; dirty way for me to do URL forwarding. With URL forwarding, I will no longer need to set up DNS records or page rules. The former requires domain verification. Plus, social media websites do not support custom domains (why will they). The latter costs money (the first 3 page rules are free).
My worker&amp;rsquo;s name was &amp;quot;vanity&amp;quot; for obvious reasons and it sits at https://www.</description>

      <description>Something could&amp;rsquo;ve happened in the past 2 weeks while I focused on fixing my unit tests. It had been some time since I last did a local deployment. To my surprise, my local deployments in the recent days rendered a blank page with the following error in the JavaScript console:
Uncaught Error: [$injector:modulerr] Failed to instantiate module FormSG due to: Error: [$injector:modulerr] Failed to instantiate module forms due to: Error: [ng:areq] Argument &amp;#39;directiveFactory&amp;#39; is required My Google-fu was lacking.</description>

      <description>My pre-commit hook complained because the original code had an import that looked like var module = require(&amp;quot;module&amp;quot;). The permitted ways to import are: import foo = require(&#39;foo&#39;) and &amp;ldquo;ES2015-style imports&amp;rdquo; which (I think) is defined in this part of the MDN web docs. I wonder when this rule was inserted&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I needed to test a feature which I have been building for GovTech&amp;rsquo;s FormSG. To test it, I had to mock a function in the superclass of an instance generated by a factory method call. I once considered stripping away the barriers between the mock and the test. But, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to refactor a codebase which I am not too familiar with.
Below is a visualisation of the &amp;ldquo;barriers&amp;rdquo; between the mock and the test:</description>

      <description>I added my domains to Cloudflare. Cloudflare offers many cool features that my domain providers do not offer. Well, they did not need to offer those features. In Cloudflare, I get to see features such as:
 Web traffic analytics Set up DNSSEC Configure network transport options and/or optimisations Run speed tests on my site Configure caching Run JavaScript workers Restrict image hotlinking  This list is non-exhaustive. There are more features in the Pro and Enterprise subscriptions.</description>

      <description>A few days ago, I purchased the jiayee.net domain. Yesterday, I purchased the jiay.ee domain. It was a novel experience for me. I last &amp;ldquo;purchased&amp;rdquo; a domain from Freenom about 3 years ago. Back then, I had the free domain point to my AWS EC2 public IP address (this was for CS3216). This week, my custom domains are pointing towards GitHub pages and Blogger respectively.
For GitHub pages, I followed a guide which is like this one by Rich.</description>

      <description>I wrote my first yarn package (kind of for fun) yesterday. It&amp;rsquo;s strange how I&amp;rsquo;ve been consuming packages but never went to the other side of the table: Writing a package. As of now, I haven&amp;rsquo;t published my package, but I&amp;rsquo;m omw. So, how did I create a package? It just felt like the usual&amp;hellip; I followed the yarn docs.
One difference (compared to my usual activities) was I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do import { .</description>

      <description>I was right. I forgot to enable the Mongo repository. And it wasn&amp;rsquo;t only that. I had two Mongo configuration classes. One in the consumer and another in the custom starter. I needed only one. I removed the configuration class from the custom starter. Then, I enabled the custom starter&amp;rsquo;s repository in the consumer&amp;rsquo;s configuration class. Below is an idea of how my configuration class looks like:
@EnableMongoRepositories(basePackages = { &amp;#34;yourTLD.</description>

      <title>Auto-configuring controllers and repositories</title>

      <description>I auto-configured Spring Boot REST controllers by adding their names to the spring.factories file. On the other hand, I did not have much luck with auto-configuring Mongo collections (yet).
I then ran the consumer&amp;rsquo;s codebase and used Postman to hit the newly-offered endpoints. Below is the response seen in Postman:
{ &amp;#34;error&amp;#34;: { &amp;#34;IllegalArgumentException&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;Couldn&amp;#39;t find PersistentEntity for type class yourTLD.yourOrg.yourProject.somePackage.SomeModel!&amp;#34; } } I thought the Mongo repository was not auto-configured, so I went to check the consumer&amp;rsquo;s logs.</description>

      <title>Spring Boot Auto-configuration</title>

      <description>Every time I use Spring Security, I have to copy and paste a lot of boilerplate code. What if I made the boilerplate code configurable? I decided to venture into this idea.
At first, I extracted only the method body which configures HttpSecurity. So I got myself something like a utility library. But this meant there was still some boilerplate code outside of the library. This approach required consumers to define their own configuration classes (annotated with @Configuration).</description>
