      <title>Javascript heap limit</title>

      <description>For the past week, I could not fathom why my diffs seemed to not be on hot reload. It turned out to be a JavaScript heap limit problem. As a result, the codebase did not rebuild and remained stale. This issue does not happen to everyone. I am using a MacBook Air (13-inch, 2017) with 8 GB of RAM.
Notice the line above the last which says, FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory.</description>

      <description>If you need your Redux store to last beyond a page load or refresh, look no further! redux-persist is here to the rescue. Based on this guide and this guide, you need to update your reducers and store to enjoy persistence:
Install redux-persist:
yarn add redux-persist @types/redux-persist Update root reducer and store:
// Copied from the official README and edited import { Provider } from &amp;#39;react-redux&amp;#39;; import { createStore, Store } from &amp;#39;redux&amp;#39;; import { persistReducer, persistStore } from &amp;#39;redux-persist&amp;#39;; import storage from &amp;#39;redux-persist/lib/storage&amp;#39;; import rootReducer from &amp;#39;.</description>

      <description>There were instances where users filled up a time-consuming form but could not submit it because of reCaptcha failure. Users ended up having to refresh and re-populate the form. That&amp;rsquo;s some harsh user experience. My team uses a forked version of angular-recaptcha. I located the controller, directive and template for the form. I attached a recursive $timeout at the controller and the directive, but as of now, I have not gotten them to work.</description>

      <description>Chapter 5 and 6 were about basic data structures (like arrays, slices and maps) and functions.
package main import &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; func main() { // Chapter 5: Arrays, slices and maps  var x [5]int x[4] = 100 fmt.Println(x) // No coercing when there is a division operation involving a float64 and int  // i.e. (mismatched types float64 and int)  // Should do a / float64(b)  var total float64 = 0 for i, value := range x { total += value } // Different from Python&amp;#39;s range  // Compiler will complain &amp;#34;i declared and not used&amp;#34;, so we must rename unused variables to &amp;#39;_&amp;#39;.</description>

      <description>It was a busy weekend for me. Last Saturday, I went out to catch up with my friends, and I went shopping for an ebook reader. Last Sunday, I cycled with my in-laws and played computer games. On both days, I travelled by public transport, so a couple of hours went into travelling too. Over the weekend, I also had to set up my ebook reader. Besides my HumbleBundle books, I borrowed some books from NLB via OverDrive.</description>

      <description>My friends needed an interest calculator. For the simple interest calculator, the parameters are:
 The principal (P), Annual interest rate (r), Number of months (t), and An optional parameter to represent a periodic top-up amount.  Here&amp;rsquo;s v1 of my simple interest calculator:
/** * Calculates simple interest. * * Uses the formula A = P(1 + rt). * * @param {Object} param Object containing parameters. * @param {Number} param.</description>

      <description>I had a tooltip for a switch which contained 2 lines of text. The first line of the tooltip shows how users can fill the textarea field nearby. The second line reminds users to meet certain prerequisites before filling the field. My GovTech OSS buddy suggested shortening the tooltip depending on user interaction.
At first, the tooltip looked like:
&amp;lt;i class=&amp;#34;...&amp;#34; uib-tooltip=&amp;#34;Here&amp;#39;s the one and only static tooltip!&amp;#34; tooltip-trigger=&amp;#34;&amp;#39;click mouseenter&amp;#39;&amp;#34; &amp;gt;&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; uib-tooltip seems to come from UI Bootstrap.</description>

      <title>Intercepting Angular Data Binding</title>
      <link>https://jiayee.net/2020/09/intercepting-angular-data-binding/</link>

      <guid>https://jiayee.net/2020/09/intercepting-angular-data-binding/</guid>
      <description>I have two form switches. Let&amp;rsquo;s call them A and B. I had to program them such that:
 When A is off, disable and switch B off. When A is on, disable and switch B off.  We can ignore backend logic because I programmed it such that if A is off, ignore B.
So, how did I solve this? I intercepted the data binding with a directive. This may not be the best solution, but it was so convenient and intuitive to me!</description>

      <description>I managed to catch one of the NUS Hackers&amp;rsquo; workshops, &amp;ldquo;Hacker Tools: Data Wrangling&amp;rdquo; by Julius. I got to learn many new things since I don&amp;rsquo;t use CLI for text processing. Julius&amp;rsquo; slides are in his GitHub repo.
Below is a very brief and dry summary of what is more important to me. If I &amp;ldquo;miss&amp;rdquo; something out, it&amp;rsquo;s likely because I remembered it before. This summary does no justice to the workshop, but I want to write them down here before I forget.</description>

      <title>Style Fixes 1</title>

      <description>I discovered there were some unexpected styles for &amp;lt;code&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; in this site. This is due to Foundation&amp;rsquo;s default styles. The inline code style was fine, but the same style applied to code blocks (i.e. &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;), and that was not fine. There was also insufficient margin and padding for the code blocks. I inspected the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt; elements. I found out that Foundation was the culprit. It has been styling the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt; elements on top of what Hugo has in store.</description>

A summary of the improvements I made:
 Include lang attribute to the html element i.e. &amp;lt;html lang=&amp;quot;en&amp;quot;&amp;gt;.</description>

      <description>Hello to my new theme! Indeed&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;You Day&amp;rdquo; was yesterday, and I spent the day redesigning this site. I am very pleased with the result. I was able to follow my hand-drawn wireframe to produce this theme. While this is a simple theme, I made sure to consider these things:
 Little clutter Consistent margin between sections. The margin was 2rem between sections and 1rem between post metadata and content. Only 3 font sizes (Foundation&amp;rsquo;s h1, h3 and h5) Only 3 colours (background colour: #F5F5F5, font colour: #333333 and dark turquoise: #26867C) Reduction of eye strain with lower contrast of colours Colour-blind friendly  Through this experience, I gained more exposure to Hugo and Foundation.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time to put my short custom domain to good use. Cloudflare Workers is a quick &amp;lsquo;n&amp;rsquo; dirty way for me to do URL forwarding. With URL forwarding, I will no longer need to set up DNS records or page rules. The former requires domain verification. Plus, social media websites do not support custom domains (why will they). The latter costs money (the first 3 page rules are free).
My worker&amp;rsquo;s name was &amp;quot;vanity&amp;quot; for obvious reasons and it sits at https://www.</description>

      <description>Something could&amp;rsquo;ve happened in the past 2 weeks while I focused on fixing my unit tests. It had been some time since I last did a local deployment. To my surprise, my local deployments in the recent days rendered a blank page with the following error in the JavaScript console:
Uncaught Error: [$injector:modulerr] Failed to instantiate module FormSG due to: Error: [$injector:modulerr] Failed to instantiate module forms due to: Error: [ng:areq] Argument &amp;#39;directiveFactory&amp;#39; is required My Google-fu was lacking.</description>

      <description>My pre-commit hook complained because the original code had an import that looked like var module = require(&amp;quot;module&amp;quot;). The permitted ways to import are: import foo = require(&#39;foo&#39;) and &amp;ldquo;ES2015-style imports&amp;rdquo; which (I think) is defined in this part of the MDN web docs. I wonder when this rule was inserted&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I needed to test a feature which I have been building for GovTech&amp;rsquo;s FormSG. To test it, I had to mock a function in the superclass of an instance generated by a factory method call. I once considered stripping away the barriers between the mock and the test. But, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to refactor a codebase which I am not too familiar with.
Below is a visualisation of the &amp;ldquo;barriers&amp;rdquo; between the mock and the test:</description>

      <description>A few days ago, I purchased the jiayee.net domain. Yesterday, I purchased the jiay.ee domain. It was a novel experience for me. I last &amp;ldquo;purchased&amp;rdquo; a domain from Freenom about 3 years ago. Back then, I had the free domain point to my AWS EC2 public IP address (this was for CS3216). This week, my custom domains are pointing towards GitHub pages and Blogger respectively.
For GitHub pages, I followed a guide which is like this one by Rich.</description>

As of now, I haven&amp;rsquo;t published my package, but I&amp;rsquo;m omw. So, how did I create a package? It just felt like the usual&amp;hellip; I followed the yarn docs.
One difference (compared to my usual activities) was I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do import { .</description>
